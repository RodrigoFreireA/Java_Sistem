ToyLog Frontend (Angular)

This is a minimal Angular scaffold to interact with the ToyLog backend.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Run (requires `@angular/cli` which is in devDependencies):

```bash
npm start
```

The app expects the backend at `http://localhost:8080`.
